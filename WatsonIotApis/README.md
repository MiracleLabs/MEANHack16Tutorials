# Consuming Watson IoT APIs in a Web Application - MEANHack '16 Training

This repository is used for publishing messages from an application to devices using MQTT Protocol via the Watson IoT Platform. It is a part of the training material for the teams participating in MEANHack '16  at Digital Summit '16(Visakhapatnam, IND).

In this demo we are using a Node JS Library called "ibmiotf" which helps your Node application to connect to Watson IoT Platform and in turn we can publish events to the Watson IoT Platform. You will also learn how to navigate through the Watson IoT Platform and access API Keys for the devices and platform.
