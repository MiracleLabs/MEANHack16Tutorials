# MEANHack '16 Training - Code Packets

MEANHack '16 is a 24-hour code-a-thon conducted as part of Digital Summit 2016 from December 16th-17th, 2016 in Visakhapatnam, AP. The code-a-thon is aimed at allowing students to build creative new applications focussed around Cloud, MEAN Stack, Cognitive, IoT and Mobile technologies. Students compete to build a working prototype of one of three applications that Miracle needs for 2017 to improve productivity and experience of its employees.

This repository contains the code packets that were used in the video tutorials for the competing teams, but the tutorials can be used by anyone who is looking to learn new technologies. The repo will help them get started with the tutorials by giving ready to use code. For any questions regarding the repository and its contents please contact innovation@miraclesoft.com.
